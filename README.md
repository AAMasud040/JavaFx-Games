Personal Note: This repo contains some of the games that I have self practiced/made using JavaFx during my Advance Object Oriented Course.

What is JavaFx ?


JavaFX is an open source, next generation client application platform for desktop, mobile and embedded systems built on Java. It is a collaborative effort by many individuals and companies with the goal of producing a modern, efficient, and fully featured toolkit for developing rich client applications.
